# TrueLayer
## TrueLayer press static page

### Layout

I chose a masonry grid for the press card items, as this allows for varying content sizes and flexibility and is scalable and easy to reuse and add further press items. Further down the line we could add a load button or scroll loading easily if required.

In terms of hierarchy, I thought it was important to give importance to the press logos. The logos are in a row of their own with a strong background colour. For the individual press grid items I used the press logos instead of the usual author icons on the top left to prioritise visual hierarchy, as the content flows from left to right.

### Libraries used

- jQuery (used by TrueLayer and helpful for creating short Masonry init script)
- Bootstrap v4
- Masonry
- FontAwesome

[Masonry Cascading grid layout library](https://masonry.desandro.com/)

I originally tried to use Bootstrap card library to create a masonry grid but found that CSS columns didn’t give enough control over ordering. I thought that date ordering should read from left to right, so I used the Masonry Cascading grid layout library, which allows for this functionality.

I installed Bootstrap as a node module using NPM.

### Animations

To keep it clean and simple like the TrueLayer brand, I’ve added a fade in, scale and drop shadow style on hover for each of the grid items.

### Illustration

I updated the TrueLayer PC svg illustration and created an isometric megaphone and rolling newspaper for 'press' style graphics.

You can see my other illustration options [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cid81aj33v3x7pv/truelayer-press-graphic-v1.ai?dl=0)

I would like to explore animating the transparent speech bubbles.

### Design

I have tried to maintain TrueLayer's visual language and code style and have tried to add my own personal touch. I designed the layout in Sketch before building the press page.

Thank you!
